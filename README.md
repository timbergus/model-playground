# Model Playground

This CLI contains tools to manage models.

It's based on [Bun](https://bun.sh), so you need to install it to use the CLI. Don't worry, its cool üòÅ

Clone the repo and install it locally as global application: `npm install -g .`. To install dependencies run `bun install`.

Then use one of the available commands.

## Extract

This command requires a file with a name ended in `model.xlsx` or `values.xlsx` depending if it is a model file or a values file. You can also add a `-p`, `--path` option to tell the tool where to create the parsed file.

The parsed files will be `JSON` files that can be used through the model hooks: `useModel` and `useValues` (in `src/tools`).
